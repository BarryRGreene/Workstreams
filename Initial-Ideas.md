# Workstreams
Brainstorming possible workstreams


# Testing & Measurement
- Would be nice to have a standard recommended dnsperf test configuration, so across different implementers there is an apples-to-apples benchmark tool - https://www.dnsperf.com/
- This can also be used by independent measurement researcher & orgs

# Resolver Discovery & Selection

# Canary Domains / Conflict Detection
- 

# Scaling / Architecture Discussions
What are the changes in architecture, scaling models, and deployment created by DNS Encryption requirements?

# Security / Attack Resilience
DNS Resolver deployments are based on UDP traffic. TCP is a backup path. Security defenses, architectures, and tools are built on a "DNS is UDP" world. Encrypted DNS will require every Operator to rethink their DNS Resolver deployments.
